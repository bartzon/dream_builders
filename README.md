### Objective
Reach **$500,000 in revenue**.

### Game Flow
- **Hero Selection**: Choose one of the 5 available heroes at the start of the game.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1.  **Start of Turn**:
      *   Automatic sales from Products with inventory occur.
      *   Overhead costs for active Products are paid.
      *   Capital is gained (base amount increases with game turn, max 10).
      *   Passive effects from cards in play trigger.
      *   Draw 1 card (or as modified by effects).
      *   Hero ability is refreshed if used previously.
  2.  **Main Phase**: Play cards from your hand, use your hero power (once per turn).
  3.  **End of Turn**: Temporary effects expire.
- **Winning/Losing**: 
    - Win by reaching $500,000 revenue.
    - Lose if you cannot make any valid plays (no cards in deck, no playable cards in hand, and no products with inventory to sell).

### Card Types
- **üü¢ Products**: Generate revenue. Have inventory that depletes with sales. Some have overhead costs.
- **üîµ Actions**: One-time effects; discarded after play.
- **üü£ Tools**: Provide ongoing passive or triggered benefits while in play.
- **üü† Employees**: Similar to Tools, provide ongoing benefits or abilities.

## üéÆ Key Implemented Mechanics

*   **Core Game Loop**: Turn progression, capital gain, card draw.
*   **Card Play**: Playing Actions, Tools, Employees, and Products.
*   **Resource Management**: Capital for playing cards, Revenue as the win condition.
*   **Product System**: Products have inventory, generate revenue via automatic sales and card effects. Overhead costs are processed.
*   **Cost Discounts**: Various cards and hero powers provide temporary or specific cost reductions (e.g., Shoestring Budget, Resourceful Solutions, Solo Hustler's hero power).
*   **Delayed Effects**: Some effects trigger over subsequent turns (e.g., Fulfillment App Integration, Automation Architect's hero power).
*   **Basic Passive Effects**: Some Tools and Employees provide simple recurring benefits (e.g., gain capital).
*   **Player Choices**: Basic choice system for effects like discarding cards (Midnight Oil), destroying products (Fast Pivot), or choosing a product for an effect (most Inventory Support cards).
*   **UI Bonus Indicators**: Visual cues on cards for active discounts, revenue bonuses, and delayed effect counters.

## üöß Known Missing Features / TODOs

*   **Audience Mechanic**: This is a major planned mechanic, especially for Brand Builder and Community Leader, but is not yet implemented. Many card texts refer to gaining or using Audience.
*   **Complex Card Effects**: Several cards have placeholder or simplified effects:
    *   **Quick Learner**: Does not currently copy last Action.
    *   **Analytics Dashboard**: Does not yet offer a choice to view/discard cards from deck.
    *   **Scale Systems**: Does not yet repeat the first recurring effect.
    *   **Custom App**: Cannot yet be played as an Action to copy a Tool effect.
    *   **Zap Everything**: Triggers some simple recurring effects, but not all or choice-based ones.
    *   Many hero powers have simplified targeting or choice-making (e.g., Brand Builder, Serial Founder).
*   **Advanced UI for Choices**: UI for more complex choices (e.g., choose from multiple options for Incubator Resources, multi-select for Warehouse Expansion beyond 3) needs to be developed.
*   **Multiplayer**: Currently single-player only. BoardGame.io supports multiplayer, but UI and some game logic (e.g., "teammate" effects) would need adaptation.
*   **Comprehensive Card Balance & Testing**.
